    <h1>An example of data privacy in action</h1>
    <p>Consider a budgeting app that people use to track
        spending and other sensitive financial information.
        When a user signs up, the app displays a privacy notice that
        clearly explains the data it collects and how it uses that data.
        The user can accept or reject each use of their data individually.</p>
